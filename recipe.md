Given below are the guidelines/directions to be followed in order to prepare White Sauce Pasta:-

Step 1:
Take 4-5 cups water in deep sauce pan and boil it over medium flame. When it starts boiling, add 3/4 cup Penne pasta and 1/2 teaspoon salt.

Step 2:
Boil them until they are cooked properly, but not very soft! It may take around 10-12 minutes. To check whether it is cooked or not, take one pasta in a fork and bite it. If it is little firm to bite, you are good to go, but if it is too hard to bite, it requires more cooking!

Step 3:
Transfer cooked pasta to a large colander and drain excess water. You may leave it there for a while for the water to drain out properly.

Step 4:
Now, take 1/2 teaspoon oil in a pan or another cooking container and heat it over high flame. Add 1/4 cup chopped carrot, 1/4 cup chopped green capsicum, 1/4 cup chopped red capsicum, 1/4 cup chopped broccoli and salt. You can even add veggies of your own choice, like sweet corn, onion, mushroom etc.

Step 5:
Stir and cook until veggies are little cooked but still crunchy, for around 2-3 minutes. Turn off the flame and transfer them to a plate.

Step 6:
Heat 1+1/2 tablespoons butter in the same pan or container over medium flame. Add 1/2 teaspoon finely chopped garlic and fry (saute) for 30 seconds.

Step 7:
Add 1+1/2 teaspoons maida(all purpose flour). Stir continuously and cook for a minute.

Step 8:
Pour 1+1/2 cups milk(250ml) little by little while stirring continuously with a whisk. Stir and mix for 1-2 minutes.

Step 9:
Reduce flame to low. Continue stirring and cooking until mixture starts to thicken. It may take around 3-4 minutes or more (depends on the size and thickness of pan). When mixture starts to coat the back of a spoon, it means that it has started to thicken.

Step 10:
Add 1/4 teaspoon oregano, 1/4 teaspoon red chilli flakes, a pinch of black pepper powder and salt. Then mix well.

Step 11:
Add sauteed (fried) vegetables and pasta. Turn off the flame and mix everything well and thoroughly.

Step 12:
Transfer it to a serving plate. White Sauce Pasta is now ready! Garnish it with grated cheese and serve while they are still hot!
