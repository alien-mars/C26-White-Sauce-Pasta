White Sauce Pasta!
White Sauce Pasta is a delicious dish made of pasta, butter, milk, cheese and herbs. It is basically cooked pasta tossed in cheesy white aauce, which is made using flour, butter and milk! It has it's origin from Italy. The aromatic fresh sauce, spread all over the pasta, with a pinch of spice and other masala flavours are enough to delight anybody's tastebuds! My daddy was the first to make this white sauce pasta for me because i insisted him to do so. I just love white sauce pasta badly, and when he made that for me, i lost myself into completely another world! I am always momentarily transported into heaven after eating his hand-made white sauce pasta!! And till date, nobody could beat his pasta's taste. So here i am going to share the steps to make White Sauce Pasta...and i hope someone will try to prepare the dish in a determined way and win everybody's heart! If anybody is successful to do so, DO NOT forget to share the dish with me...because i should taste it..being a pasta lover! :D
